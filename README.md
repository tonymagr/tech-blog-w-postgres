## Description

This is a content management system (CMS) blog site where developers can publish and manage their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts. This app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for client requests handled by server routes which access the Sequelize database (connected to PostgreSQL). Handlebars.js is used as the templating (extended HTML) language. <br>
Two levels of access are provided, described in Usage section.

## Installation

Required Node.js packages for this application are:
- Express (web app framework)
- PostgreSQL (database access)
- Sequelize (object-relational mapping, ORM, of code to PostgreSQL)
- Dotenv (manages private environment variables for use in code)
- Bcrypt (password hashing tool)
- Express-handlebars (client-side templating language for HTML)
- Express-session (saves and manages session data, including auth data) <br>

CLI server command in repo:  npm run watch <br>
Client URL for app home page is:  http://localhost:5432/

## Usage

Two levels of access are provided, depending on if the user signs up to the application and/or later logs on. Logged in users have access to their own dashboard to create their own blog posts and later update or delete them. Everyone else has basic access to view others' blog posts and comments. <br>
